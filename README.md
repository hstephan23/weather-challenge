I am creating a webpage that displays the weather in a given city

This relies on the free API's created by Open Weather Map.
The functionality is simple as it relies on the searching of a city name to pull a latitude and longitude from an API and then put that out to the correct API to get the current weather and the forecast weather. The search bar will then generate search items that store up to the 8 last items searched. These are buttons that can be pressed to research for that item. This is done using local storage. It will autofill to Nampa, Idaho on first load as local storage would be empty.

The link for the webpage is: https://hstephan23.github.io/weather-challenge/? 

The webpage looks like this:
